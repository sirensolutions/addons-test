# Siren Jira Case Management Add-on

## Overview
The **Siren Jira Case Management Add-on** integrates Jira with the Siren platform to provide a unified case and investigation management environment. It synchronizes Jira issues, metadata, and relationships into Siren, enabling investigators and analysts to manage cases, track workflows, and analyze operational activity alongside intelligence data.

This add-on bridges operational case tracking with Siren’s analytics, search, and graph capabilities, allowing teams to move seamlessly between investigation data and case management workflows.

## What It Does

The Siren Jira Case Management Add-on:

- Synchronizes Jira issues and linked cases into Siren

- Visualizes case relationships using Siren graph analytics  
- Enables investigators to view and manage case activity within investigation context  
- Connects operational workflows with intelligence datasets  
- Supports dashboards, reporting, and case monitoring  

Jira issues become structured entities inside Siren, allowing analysts to explore relationships between cases, entities, and events.
